          <p>I've spent most of my life feeling fundamentally alone. Even in relationships even surrounded by people I carried this deep sense that no one really knew me. And if no one really knew me then I was alone no matter how many people were physically present.</p>
<p>I no longer need to believe that I am alone in any aspect of my life. This sentence describes a transformation I didn't think was possible. I no longer need to believe I'm alone. The aloneness wasn't truth – it was a belief I could change. And Step Five changed it.</p>
<p>By sharing my complete inventory with another person – holding nothing back being fully known – the belief in fundamental aloneness shattered. Someone knows me completely and hasn't rejected me. Someone sees my character defects and still accepts me. Someone understands my struggles because they have similar ones.</p>
<p>The aloneness was maintained by secrets. Every secret I kept reinforced the belief that I had to be alone because no one could handle the real me. Step Five broke that cycle. Now I know I'm not alone. And I don't need to believe that lie anymore.</p>

          <p>When loneliness hits and I start to believe I'm fundamentally alone, I can remember Step Five. Someone knows me completely and accepts me fully. I've been truly seen and not rejected. The aloneness is a lie I don't have to believe anymore.</p>
