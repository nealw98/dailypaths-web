          <p>In the alcoholic home, I learned to hide everything. Feelings were dangerous. Money mistakes were shameful. Bad news meant punishment. So I became a vault—locked, secretive, self-contained. Independence wasn't strength; it was survival.</p>
<p>Concept Ten talks about reporting results in service work, but I'm applying it to marriage. "Here's what I spent. Here's what I'm feeling. Here's where I failed today." These sentences make my chest tighten. Transparency feels like handing someone ammunition.</p>
<p>But secrecy isn't intimacy—it's loneliness. I've confused self-protection with partnership. Every hidden bank statement, every swallowed emotion, every "I'm fine" when I'm not builds a wall between me and connection. I'm safe behind it, but I'm also alone.</p>
<p>Al-Anon is teaching me that reporting results isn't about accountability in the corporate sense—it's about the intimacy of being known. It's saying "Here is what I did today" without fear of retribution. It's the vulnerability of transparency, trusting that honesty won't be weaponized.</p>
<p>The shift is slow. Old habits of secrecy die hard. But occasionally, I practice: "I overspent today." "I'm struggling." "I need help." And the world doesn't end.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>When I notice myself hiding something small (a purchase, a feeling, a mistake), I can pause and ask: Am I protecting myself or isolating myself? Can I practice transparency with one low-stakes truth today and notice what happens when I'm not hiding? What if reporting results is the intimacy I've been avoiding?</p>
