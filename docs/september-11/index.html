          <p>When I first looked at Step Nine, I immediately found reasons not to make certain amends. I told myself it would cause the other person harm, when the truth was, I was anticipating my own acute discomfort. I was trying to spare <em>myself</em> the pain of vulnerability and the potential for rejection. My shame wanted to stay hidden, claiming protection for others as its excuse. This self-protection was a clever, corrosive form of selfishness.</p>
<p>The gap between intellectual understanding and emotional reality was huge. I knew that healing requires exposure, but every fiber of my being wanted to avoid the sting of honest admission. Only when the guilt of <em>not</em> acting became heavier than the fear of acting did I move. The cost of avoidance became greater than the cost of the amend. I realized that my self-sparing wasn't preventing guilt; it was guaranteeing its endurance.</p>

          <p>I will ask my Higher Power for the courage to face this discomfort, knowing that God walks with me through it. I will remind myself that the pain of growth is temporary, but the freedom of a clean slate is permanent.</p>
