        <section class="reading-body">
          
          <p>In Al-Anon meetings, we have no ultimate authority. Leaders are trusted servants who facilitate; they don't govern. No one person gets to decide what's best for everyone else. The group relies on a loving God expressed through group conscience, not a single voice dictating the way forward.</p>
<p>But if I don't govern the group, why am I trying to govern my family? Why do I believe I should be the ultimate authority on how my husband manages his recovery, how my daughter handles her finances, how my son navigates his relationships? When did I appoint myself General Manager of the Universe?</p>
<p>The relief of applying Tradition Two to my home is profound. I can serve my family—love them, support them, be present—without governing them. I can offer input without demanding compliance. I can express concern without requiring obedience. Serving doesn't mean controlling; it means showing up with love and letting go of outcomes.</p>
<p>Al-Anon is teaching me that being a trusted servant in my own home means resigning as the ultimate authority. I'm not God. I don't have all the answers. And trying to govern the people I love only isolates me from them. The freedom is in the resignation—stepping down from a position I was never meant to hold.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>When I catch myself trying to control a family member's choices, I can pause and ask: Am I serving or governing? Can I offer support without demanding compliance? What if loving them well means resigning as the ultimate authority in their lives and trusting God to guide them—not me?</p>
