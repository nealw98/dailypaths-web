          <p>I used to pride myself on being strong, capable, self-sufficient. I handled everything, needed no one, showed no weakness. Admitting I had frailties felt like admitting failure. I should be able to manage this. I should be strong enough to cope. Acknowledging my limitations felt shameful.</p>
<p>The Steps humbled me in a way that was surprisingly freeing. Yes, I have frailties. I'm human. I have limits to my strength, my wisdom, my endurance. I cannot handle everything alone. I need help. This realization wasn't the defeat I'd feared—it was liberation. I could finally stop pretending to be superhuman.</p>
<p>Being humbled by my frailties made me gentler with myself. I stopped demanding impossible standards of strength and started accepting my very human need for support, rest, and help. I let myself be imperfect. I let myself need others. I let myself admit when I was overwhelmed or confused or scared.</p>
<p>This humility also made me more compassionate toward others. If I have frailties, they do too. We're all human, all struggling, all doing our best with limited resources. The humility that came from acknowledging my own weakness opened my heart to everyone else's weakness too.</p>

          <p>I can acknowledge one frailty today—one area where I'm human and limited. This isn't weakness; it's honest self-awareness. Admitting my frailties makes me gentler with myself and more compassionate toward others who are also imperfect and struggling.</p>
