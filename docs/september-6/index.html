          <p>I used to think saying 'I'm sorry' was the magic eraser. I would explode in anger, say I was sorry, and expect life to return to normal. But my family didn't trust my apologies because my behavior didn't change. I was using apologies to buy immediate relief from my own guilt, not to repair the relationship. That is manipulation, not recovery.</p>
<p>Understanding that amends are not just apologies changed everything. It meant I had to ask, 'What can I do to make this right?' sometimes the answer was to give them space, pay back money, or simply stop talking. This feels heavier than a quick apology because it requires labor. It requires me to sit with the reality that my words have lost value and only action can restore it. I have to earn trust back, one action at a time.</p>

          <p>Instead of saying 'I'm sorry' for a recurring issue today, I can ask the person, 'What can I do differently next time to support you?' When they answer, I can write it down and commit to that specific action.</p>
