          <p>Before Al-Anon I felt distant from everyone – from God from other people even from myself. I couldn't articulate what I needed or wanted or felt. I couldn't trust that God heard my prayers or cared about my pain. I couldn't believe people would accept me if they really knew me. The distance felt permanent and unbridgeable.</p>
<p>Step Five brings us closer to our Higher Power and helps us learn to trust both God and other people on our spiritual journey. This dual closeness is what I need – not just connection with God or just connection with people but both. They reinforce each other. When I trust a person enough to share my Fifth Step my trust in God deepens. When I trust God enough to do this scary thing my capacity to trust people grows.</p>
<p>The distance I felt wasn't permanent. It was maintained by secrets and shame and isolation. Step Five bridges the gap by breaking the isolation. I move closer to God by being honest with another person. I move closer to people by trusting God's guidance in choosing who to trust.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>If I feel distant from God or from people, I can remember that Step Five is designed to bridge both gaps. Sharing honestly with one person I trust brings me closer to my Higher Power and builds my capacity to trust both. The closeness comes through the honesty.</p>
