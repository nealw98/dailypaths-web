          <p>"Came to believe" initially felt like a roadblock, demanding a settled faith I didn't possess. How could I work a Step rooted in a conviction that hadn't yet arrived? It felt like being asked to describe a destination I'd never visited, a belief system I hadn’t fully embraced. This past tense felt accusatory, highlighting my present lack.</p>
<p>Then, a quiet understanding dawned: the past tense isn't a judgment, but an invitation. It signifies that acknowledging a Power greater than myself isn't a prerequisite, but an evolving journey. What a relief to realize that my skepticism wasn't a barrier, but part of the authentic process of coming to belief—a gradual unfolding, born from vulnerability and consistent presence, not from forced conviction.</p>
<p>This insight allowed me to loosen my grip on the need for immediate, perfect faith. I just needed to show up, with all my doubts, and stay open to the possibility. It freed me to stop trying to intellectually grasp belief, and instead, simply allowed it to develop within me, step-by-step, through the very act of living the program.</p>

          <p>I don't need perfect faith today. I just need willingness to stay open to the possibility that a Power greater than myself could help. Belief grows through experience, not through forcing myself to believe something I don't yet feel. I can trust the process.</p>
