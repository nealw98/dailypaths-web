          <p>I've been reflecting on how recovery works. Early on I was just receiving – I came to meetings desperate for help. I listened. I took. I absorbed everything anyone offered. I couldn't imagine having anything to give back. I was too broken too new too messed up to help anyone else.</p>
<p>Individual freedom and belonging are both of enormous importance to our recovery as we help and are helped by each other. The helping and being helped – it's not sequential. I don't get helped first and then help others later. It happens simultaneously. Even when I thought I had nothing to offer my presence at meetings helped someone. My willingness to be vulnerable helped someone feel less alone.</p>
<p>And now I see clearly: I'm helped and helping at the same time. When I sponsor someone I'm helping them and being helped by the questions they ask. When I share at meetings I'm helping someone hear what they need and being helped by the clarity that comes from speaking truth out loud. The helping and being helped are inseparable.</p>
<p>This is how belonging works in recovery. Not one-directional charity but mutual support. We help and are helped by each other continuously.</p>

          <p>I can notice today how I'm both helping and being helped simultaneously. When I share at a meeting I'm offering help and receiving clarity. When I listen to someone's struggle I'm being helped by their honesty. The mutuality is constant – I don't have to wait until I'm 'better' to help others.</p>
