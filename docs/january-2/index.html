        <section class="reading-body">
          
          <p>I came to Al-Anon desperate. Not curious, not casually interested – desperate. My life had become a tangle of unmanageable chaos, and I was drowning. I didn't come seeking enlightenment or spiritual growth. I came looking for relief.</p>
<p>There's profound honesty in acknowledging this. I've learned that recovery doesn't require me to have noble motivations or lofty goals. It simply asks me to be honest about my pain. The chaos that drove me here – the sleepless nights, the constant monitoring, the sense that I was losing myself – this was enough. This was valid.</p>
<p>I used to judge my reasons for seeking help as somehow less worthy than others'. I thought I should be more evolved, more spiritually motivated. But desperation is its own form of wisdom. It cuts through denial and brings us to truth. My unmanageable life was the teacher I needed, showing me I couldn't continue as I had been.</p>
<p>Relief comes first. Understanding comes later. I don't need to comprehend the entire journey before I take the first step. I simply need to acknowledge that I'm exhausted from trying to manage the unmanageable, and that I've come to the right place. Even after that first meeting, I left feeling still raw and desperate, but with a tiny bit of hope.</p>
