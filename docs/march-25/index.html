          <p>I found a friend who will always be there for me. This is how I've come to understand my Higher Power – as a friend. Not a judge or a taskmaster or a distant authority but a companion who walks with me through everything. This friendship has become the most reliable relationship in my life.</p>
<p>Human friendships are wonderful but limited. People get busy have their own problems sometimes disappoint or abandon us. Not because they're bad but because they're human. I can't expect any person to be available to me at all times to meet all my needs to never let me down. That would be asking them to be what only a Higher Power can be.</p>
<p>But this Friend is always available. At three in the morning when I wake up anxious. In the middle of a crisis when I need immediate help. On holidays when everyone else is busy. During the long stretches when I feel alone in my struggles. This Friend never sleeps never tires never has other obligations that take priority.</p>
<p>The friendship isn't one-sided. I have responsibilities too – to show up to be honest to listen to trust. But unlike human friendships where I might worry about being too needy or asking too much this Friend welcomes my presence. I cannot exhaust this relationship. There's always more help available.</p>
