        <section class="reading-body">
          
          <p>Last week, I was driving to work, and suddenly tears started streaming down my face. Not sad tears, but grateful tears. I realized I'd been praying without thinking about it, asking for help with a difficult conversation I needed to have, turning over my anxiety about a project deadline, and thanking God for the sunrise. When did prayer become this natural?</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, I became aware of God working in my life. The awareness didn't come all at once; it crept in gradually as I paid attention. A problem resolving in a way I couldn't have orchestrated. Strength appearing when I thought I had none left. The right person saying the right thing at exactly the right moment. Peace arriving in the middle of chaos.</p>
<p>I used to think God working meant obvious miracles—dramatic interventions that proved divine presence. But God's work in my life has been quieter than that. More subtle. Like gentle course corrections. Like doors opening just as others close. Like wisdom appearing when I'm willing to receive it.</p>
<p>The awareness itself is the gift. I'm not living in a random universe where I'm alone with my problems. I'm living in a responsive relationship with a Power that's actively involved in my life. Slowly but surely, I'm learning to see it.</p>

          <p>I can write down three small things that went unexpectedly well this week. Not because I'm lucky, but because maybe—just maybe—a Power greater than myself is at work in ways I'm learning to see.</p>
