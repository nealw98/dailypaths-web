          <p>Before I understood alcoholism as a disease, I saw it as a series of choices I could influence. If I managed the environment carefully enough, eliminated stress, created perfect conditions – surely the drinking would stop. I was like someone trying to cure diabetes through willpower and optimism, not grasping the fundamental nature of what I was dealing with.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding drove me to extraordinary efforts. I controlled finances, monitored schedules, managed social situations, and tried to orchestrate every variable that might trigger drinking. I was exhausting myself treating a disease as if it were a behavior problem, bringing tools wholly inadequate to the task.</p>
<p>The phrase "taking things into our own hands" captures something essential about my early attempts at control. My hands were never the right instruments for this work. I was trying to perform surgery with garden tools, wondering why nothing improved. Not because I wasn't trying hard enough, but because the fundamental approach was flawed.</p>
<p>Learning that alcoholism is a disease changed everything. It helped me see that my management attempts weren't just ineffective – they were based on a misunderstanding of what I was facing. The disease required different help than I could provide. My hands needed to let go so that proper help could reach in.</p>
