          <p>Before recovery I operated as if I were in charge of everything – my own transformation other people's behavior the outcome of every situation. I made lists and plans and strategies for how to fix myself and everyone around me. I worked relentlessly at self-improvement believing if I just tried hard enough I could perfect myself.</p>
<p>Then it was pointed out to me that I am not God. Such a simple statement. So obvious when said out loud. But I'd been living as if I were God – as if I could remove my own character defects through willpower as if my effort alone could transform me. I'd forgotten that transformation is God's job not mine.</p>
<p>This reminder is humbling and liberating. Humbling because it confronts my grandiosity – the belief that I can fix myself without divine help. Liberating because it means I can stop the exhausting attempt to be my own Higher Power. I'm not God. God is God. And God is the one who removes character defects not me.</p>
<p>Step Six keeps pointing me back to this truth: my job is readiness. God's job is everything else.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>I will trust that God does not remove a defect to leave me empty. I will ask Him to fill the space where my "control" used to live with His peace, knowing that nature abhors a vacuum and Grace fills it.</p>
