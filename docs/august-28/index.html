          <p>I used to think Twelfth Step work meant sponsoring people. Since I wasn't ready to sponsor I thought I couldn't help. I couldn't do Twelfth Step work. I was just receiving, not giving.</p>
<p>Then last Tuesday after a meeting, a woman who'd been coming for three weeks told me, "You always make eye contact and smile when I walk in. Some days that's the only reason I don't turn around and leave." I was stunned. I thought I was just being friendly. She said, "You're carrying the message that I belong here."</p>
<p>I'd been doing Twelfth Step work without recognizing it. Every time I stayed after to talk with someone struggling. Every time I shared honestly about my own imperfect progress. Every time I set up chairs or made coffee. These weren't lesser forms of service—they were the work itself.</p>
<p>I can't predict which small action will matter to someone. The eye contact that keeps someone coming back. The share that makes someone feel less alone. I just do what I can, trusting that something will land where it's needed.</p>

        <section class="rd-body">
          <p>Today I can identify one form of Twelfth Step work I'm already doing: welcoming newcomers, sharing honestly, setting up chairs, staying after to talk. Acknowledge that this matters. Then I can choose one additional small form of service: offer my number to someone new, volunteer for one task, share at a meeting I usually stay quiet at.</p>
