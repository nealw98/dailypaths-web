          <p>The phrase 'being restored to sanity' always felt future tense to me—something I was waiting for, hoping for, maybe someday would achieve. I thought restoration to sanity would be a dramatic moment when everything suddenly made sense, when I finally felt completely serene and balanced. I kept waiting for that moment to arrive.</p>
<p>Then I realized restoration is happening now. Present tense. Ongoing. Every time I attend a meeting instead of obsessing alone at home, I'm being restored to sanity. Every time I set a boundary instead of enabling, I'm being restored to sanity. Every time I turn something over instead of trying to control it, I'm being restored to sanity. The restoration isn't a future destination—it's a present process.</p>
<p>This understanding changed everything. I stopped waiting for some magical moment of complete sanity and started noticing the small restorations happening daily. I'm thinking more clearly than I was a month ago. I'm responding more calmly than I did last week. I'm making better choices today than yesterday. That's restoration—gradual, ongoing, accumulating over time.</p>
<p>The new-found trust that I'm being restored to sanity gives me patience with my own progress. I don't have to be completely healed yet. I just have to trust that the process is working, that sanity is being restored bit by bit through my Higher Power and this program.</p>

          <p>I can notice signs of restoration to sanity in my life today. Am I thinking more clearly? Responding more calmly? Making better choices? These are evidence that the process is working. I can trust that restoration continues with each meeting, each prayer, each small act of recovery.</p>
