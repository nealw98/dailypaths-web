          <p>When my partner offered to take over our household budget, my first instinct was to share every meticulous detail. For years, I’ve managed this task, convinced only I could do it "right." I found myself listing specific expectations, and I could almost see the familiar tension building in his shoulders as I spoke. It felt like I was handing him the reins, then immediately pulling them back.</p>
<p>In that moment of seeing his reaction, I recognized my own pattern of control. I was setting him up for the same frustration I’d often felt when trying to manage others. Al-Anon has shown me that true empowerment means giving someone not just a task, but also the space and trust to carry it out in their own way. This was a clear echo of how authority must accompany responsibility, a principle I’d heard in Al-Anon service work.</p>
<p>Letting go of my need to control felt surprisingly liberating. I handed him the budget and simply said, "It's yours. I trust you to manage it." This simple act was about stepping back and trusting his capabilities, and in a deeper sense, trusting that things would be okay, even if not done exactly my way. It was a leap of faith, not just in him, but in myself and the wisdom of my program.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>When I'm tempted to intervene in someone's decisions, I can pause and ask: Am I giving them responsibility without authority? Am I trusting them with their own life, or just with my version of their life? Can I practice standing back in one situation today, even if it means watching them make a mistake? What if the authority to fail is the only way they learn to succeed?</p>
