          <p>The instruction to focus on myself rather than the alcoholic felt almost offensive at first. Wasn't that selfish? Wasn't I supposed to help, to care, to remain vigilant? The idea of turning my attention inward seemed like abandonment, like giving up on someone I loved.</p>
<p>I had spent so long monitoring someone else's life that I'd lost track of my own. I could tell you exactly how many drinks had been consumed, what time the drinking started, or what was said in anger or confusion. But today, I realize I couldn't tell you what <em>I</em> was feeling, what <em>I</em> needed, or even who <em>I</em> was becoming in the midst of all this watching and managing.</p>
<p>Shifting focus wasn't abandonment—it was survival. I had to learn that keeping my attention on another person’s choices served no one. It didn't prevent drinking. It didn't create safety. It simply ensured that I was consumed by their disease too.</p>
<p>When I finally turned my gaze inward, I was startled by what I found. There was a whole person who had been neglected, whose needs had been dismissed, whose feelings had been suppressed. Taking the focus off the alcoholic wasn't selfishness—it was the beginning of remembering myself.</p>
