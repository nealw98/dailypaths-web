          <p>Last night I was putting off cleaning my house. The mess had accumulated for weeks and I knew once I started I'd find things I'd forgotten about – expired food in the back of the fridge moldy coffee cups under the couch dust everywhere. The anticipation of seeing all that mess felt worse than the actual mess itself.</p>
<p>The fear I felt prior to taking Steps Four and Five was like cleaning my house. This comparison is perfect. The fear before starting is often worse than the actual experience. I imagine it will be catastrophic – that I'll find things too terrible to face that the mess will be overwhelming that I'll never get through it all.</p>
<p>But when I actually start cleaning I discover it's manageable. Yes there's mess. Yes some of it is unpleasant. But it's not as catastrophic as I imagined. And with each thing I clean I feel lighter. The house becomes more livable. The fear that kept me from starting was worse than the actual work.</p>
<p>Step Five is the same. The anticipation and fear feel overwhelming. But the actual experience – while challenging – brings relief not catastrophe.</p>

          <p>If fear of Step Five is keeping me stuck, I can remember: the anticipation is usually worse than the reality. Just like putting off cleaning makes the task feel impossible, putting off Step Five makes the fear grow. I can set the date and trust that doing it will be less overwhelming than dreading it.</p>
