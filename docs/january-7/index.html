          <p>I carried burdens that were never mine to carry. Somewhere along the way, I had assumed responsibility for another person's sobriety, happiness, and very survival. These responsibilities felt noble, even necessary. How could I not try to save someone I loved? But nobility and impossibility often travel together.</p>
<p>Step One offered something unexpected: permission to put down what I was never meant to carry. The relief wasn't immediate—I was so accustomed to the weight that I didn't trust its absence at first. I kept reaching back for those responsibilities, convinced that without my vigilance, the alcoholic would fail, or worse. The fear of what might happen without my constant management was gripping.</p>
<p>There's a particular exhaustion that comes from trying to do the impossible. It’s not the honest fatigue of hard work but the grinding depletion of effort without effect. When I recognized that these responsibilities were impossible to fulfill, I was freed to discover what was truly mine to do. My responsibility was never to control another person's disease. It was to tend my own recovery, mind my own boundaries, and live my own life.</p>
