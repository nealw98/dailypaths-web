          <p>This morning, my sponsee called in crisis. Her husband had relapsed after six months, and she was spinning. I listened. I shared what had helped me in similar situations and offered love. Then came the hard part—letting go of whether any of it helped.</p>
<p>"Share and let go" is a principle I often forget. I want to follow up, to know if my suggestions worked, and to see if she followed my suggestion. I want to fix her pain. But that’s not my job. My job is to share my experience, strength, and hope, then release the outcome.</p>
<p>This is different from how I used to help. I’d advise, then monitor its application, feeling responsible for the results. If things didn't improve, I felt like a failure. That exhausted me and fostered dependence. Now, I'm learning to share freely and release completely, offering experience with no strings, hope without expectation, and love without requiring particular outcomes. Share and let go—both parts matter equally.</p>

        <section class="reading-application">
          <p>After I share my experience with someone, I can resist the urge to follow up repeatedly. One check-in is caring. Three is me trying to control their recovery. I share and let go—both parts matter.</p>
