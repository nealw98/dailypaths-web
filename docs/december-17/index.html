          <p>My early Steps built a foundation: I began to trust my powerlessness in Step One and, with Step Two, felt a flicker of hope that things could be different. Giving over my will in Step Three felt like a leap. But it was in the middle Steps—Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine—where I truly learned to lean on my Higher Power.</p>
<p>These Steps brought a much deeper, more specific kind of trust. I had to trust that naming my character defects wouldn’t make me a terrible person, but that my Higher Power could indeed help remove them. The idea of amends felt terrifying, a messy confrontation I wanted to avoid. Yet, in those Steps, I learned to trust that facing my part, owning my actions, wouldn't shatter me, but actually lead to a sense of peace I desperately craved.</p>
<p>It was a gradual unclenching, trusting that a Power greater than myself had my back, even as I wrestled with difficult truths about myself. This wasn't abstract trust; it was lived, practical experience that showed me my Higher Power was there, guiding me through the messy, vital work of changing.</p>

          <p>If I'm struggling to trust my Higher Power with something big, I can look back at the middle Steps. Those times I became willing, asked for help, made amends—each one taught me this Power is trustworthy. The track record is there.</p>
