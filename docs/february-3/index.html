        <section class="reading-body">
          
          <p>I came to my first meeting in complete despair. I'd tried everything I could think of to fix the situation and nothing had worked. I was exhausted, defeated, ready to give up entirely. The idea that some spiritual resource could help me seemed absurd. I'd prayed before—it didn't work. How would this be any different?</p>
<p>But something strange happened as I kept attending meetings. I watched other people who'd felt exactly as hopeless as I did. I heard them share about changes they'd experienced, peace they'd found, lives they'd rebuilt. I saw evidence that this program actually worked. And slowly, very slowly, I became encouraged. Maybe this could help. Maybe there was hope after all. Maybe I wasn't completely alone in this.</p>
<p>That encouragement was crucial. It gave me just enough hope to keep coming back, to keep listening, to consider that maybe they were onto something. I didn't have to fully believe yet—I just had to be encouraged enough to stay open. The encouragement came from seeing others' recovery, from feeling understood for the first time, from discovering I wasn't uniquely broken or beyond help.</p>
<p>Encouragement preceded belief. First I had to see evidence that change was possible. Then I could begin to believe it might be possible for me too. The group provided that encouragement when I had none of my own.</p>

          <p>If I'm struggling to believe today, I can look for encouragement instead. I can notice others' recovery, listen to their stories, let their experience give me hope. Encouragement comes first; belief follows. I don't have to force faith—I just need to stay open and keep coming back.</p>
