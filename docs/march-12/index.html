          <p>I used to believe that if I just tried hard enough I could control everything and everyone in my life. If I managed the environment carefully enough the alcoholic would stop drinking. If I monitored closely enough I could prevent disaster. If I orchestrated perfectly enough everyone would be okay. This belief drove me to exhausting efforts that never produced the results I sought.</p>
<p>The truth finally broke through: we know that we cannot control everything and everyone in our lives. Not because I haven't found the right technique or tried hard enough but because control over others is simply not available to me. It never was and never will be. This isn't a personal failing – it's a fundamental truth about how humans work.</p>
<p>Accepting this limit has been strangely freeing. I spent so much energy trying to do the impossible that I had nothing left for what was actually mine to do. My attempts to control others consumed resources that could have gone toward my own growth healing and wellbeing. I was so busy managing everyone else's lives that I neglected my own.</p>
<p>Now I'm learning to recognize the boundary between what I can influence and what lies beyond my reach. I can control my own choices responses and attitudes. That's enough. That's actually more than enough – it's a lifetime of work right there.</p>
