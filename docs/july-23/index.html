          <p>Six months ago I prayed Step Seven on my obsessive worry and nothing seemed to change. I was frustrated and skeptical. Why keep praying if God isn't responding? But my sponsor suggested I keep asking anyway and notice what happens over time. So I did. I've asked God to remove my worry probably two hundred times now. And slowly something shifted.</p>
<p>Our trust grows that God knows when and how to help us change. Trust grows. Not trust arrives fully formed. Not trust is given immediately. Trust grows through the repeated experience of asking and seeing God work - even when God's work looks different than I expected. My worry is still here. But it doesn't consume entire days anymore. I catch myself sooner. I can sometimes interrupt the spiral.</p>
<p>The change is so gradual I didn't notice it happening. But comparing today to six months ago I see it clearly. And my trust has grown. Not because I got the dramatic instant removal I wanted. But because through repeated asking I've experienced God working in God's way at God's pace. Trust grows through the practice of asking and watching for God's response over time. Not through demanding proof upfront but through patient repeated asking that lets me see God's gradual work.</p>

Then acknowledge: My trust has grown through watching God work gradually. I didn't see it happening day by day but over time the change is clear. God does know when and how.</p>
