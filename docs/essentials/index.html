            <div class="ess-card-body ess-truncated" data-ess-card-body>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will try to live through this day only, and not tackle my whole life problem at once.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will be happy. This assumes to be true what Abraham Lincoln said, that &ldquo;most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will adjust myself to what is and not try to adjust everything to my own desires.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought, and concentration.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don&rsquo;t want to do, just for exercise.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act courteously, criticize not one bit, not find fault with anything, and not try to improve or regulate anybody except myself.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.</p>

            <h3 class="ess-card-title">Just for Tonight</h3>
            <div class="ess-card-body ess-truncated" data-ess-card-body>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for tonight, I will be grateful. I will give thanks for the past day &mdash; its failures as well as its successes, its sadness as well as its joy and its pain as well as its pleasure. I will take comfort in knowing that every event and circumstance that occurred today can be used for my good and the good of others.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for tonight, I will accept that I have done the best I could, remembering that my goal is spiritual progress and not perfection. I will let go of any expectation I had for this day, as well as any disappointment, shame or guilt I felt for not being perfect today.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for tonight, I will be humble. I will give my shortcomings to a Power greater than myself, trusting that doing so can bring about changes in me that I could not bring about by myself.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for tonight, I will not attempt to rectify today&rsquo;s mistakes or solve tomorrow&rsquo;s problems. I will remind myself that I am better able to receive guidance when my mind and body are rested and refreshed.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">Just for tonight, I will set aside my fears, frustrations and aspirations and take a few minutes to review the abundance that exists in my life today. I will place my future in the care of a loving God of my own understanding, trusting my needs will be met at a time and in a way that is best for all concerned.</p>

            <div class="ess-card-body ess-truncated" data-ess-card-body>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; does not mean to stop caring, it means I can&rsquo;t do it for someone else.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to cut myself off, it&rsquo;s the realization I can&rsquo;t control another.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to enable, but to allow learning from natural consequences.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is to admit powerlessness, which means the outcome is not in my hands.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to try to change or blame another, it&rsquo;s to make the most of myself.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to care for, but to care about.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to fix, but to be supportive.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to judge, but to allow another to be a human being.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes, but to allow others to affect their own destinies.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to deny, but to accept.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to nag, scold, or argue, but instead to search out my own shortcomings and correct them.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to criticize and regulate anybody, but to try to become what I dream I can be.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is to fear less and to love more.</p>

            <div class="ess-card-body ess-truncated" data-ess-card-body>
            <p class="ess-text">If we willingly surrender ourselves to the spiritual discipline of the Twelve Steps, our lives will be transformed. We will become mature, responsible individuals with a great capacity for joy, fulfillment, and wonder. Though we may never be perfect, continued spiritual progress will reveal to us our enormous potential.</p>
            <p class="ess-text">We will discover that we are worthy of love and loving. We will love others without losing ourselves, and will learn to accept love in return. Our sight, once clouded and confused, will clear and we will be able to perceive reality and recognize truth. Courage and fellowship will replace fear.</p>
