          <p>I'd operated my whole life on the principle that relying on others was dangerous. People disappoint. People leave. People let you down. The only person I could really count on was myself. So I became fiercely independent, handling everything alone, needing no one. It felt like strength but it was really isolation and fear.</p>
<p>Learning that I can rely on other people has brought me great relief. I don't have to carry everything myself. When I'm overwhelmed, I can ask for help. When I'm confused, I can reach out for perspective. When I'm struggling, I can let others support me. This isn't weakness—it's wisdom. It's recognizing that humans need each other, that we're stronger together than alone.</p>
<p>Building relationships where I can actually rely on others took time. I had to test people's reliability, see if they followed through, learn who could be trusted with what. Not everyone is reliable for everything—but most people are reliable for something. My sponsor is reliable for program guidance. My friend is reliable for emotional support. My home group is reliable for consistent welcome.</p>
<p>The relief of knowing I can rely on others has transformed my life. I'm not alone anymore with every problem, every challenge, every crisis. I have people I can turn to. That network of reliable relationships gives me strength I never had when I was trying to be entirely self-sufficient.</p>

          <p>I can rely on other people. When I need help today, I can reach out—to my sponsor, to a program friend, to someone in my support network. Asking for help isn't weakness. It's wisdom. I don't have to handle everything alone.</p>
