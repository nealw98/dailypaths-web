          <p>Before I started my Step Four inventory I felt completely alone with it. I didn't know where to begin or what format to use or how detailed to be or what to include. The blank pages felt overwhelming. I kept waiting to feel ready but I never did.</p>
<p>Hearing other members' experiences with the Step gave me the guidance and encouragement that I needed. At meetings I started asking people about their Step Four experience. How did you organize it? How long did it take? What format did you use? What surprised you? Everyone had different approaches but hearing their stories gave me permission to start imperfectly.</p>
<p>One person said she just made lists of resentments and fears. Another described doing a timeline of his life. Someone else inventoried her beliefs. Each approach was different and each person said their inventory was valuable even though it wasn't perfect. Their encouragement gave me courage.</p>
<p>I realized I didn't have to figure this out alone. The fellowship has collective wisdom about this Step. I could learn from their experience. I could borrow their courage when I didn't have my own. I could start imperfectly knowing others had done the same and found value in the process.</p>
<p>Now when I talk about my Step Four experience I remember someone else might need to hear it. The guidance and encouragement flow through the fellowship.</p>

          <p>I can ask someone at my meeting about their Step Four experience – not to copy their approach exactly, but to hear how they did it imperfectly and still found value. Their experience can give me the encouragement I need to start my own.</p>
