            <div class="prayer-body">
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will try to live through this day only, and not tackle my whole life problem at once.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will be happy. This assumes to be true what Abraham Lincoln said, that &ldquo;most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will adjust myself to what is and not try to adjust everything to my own desires.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought, and concentration.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don&rsquo;t want to do, just for exercise.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act courteously, criticize not one bit, not find fault with anything, and not try to improve or regulate anybody except myself.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.</p>

            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; does not mean to stop caring, it means I can&rsquo;t do it for someone else.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to cut myself off, it&rsquo;s the realization I can&rsquo;t control another.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to enable, but to allow learning from natural consequences.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is to admit powerlessness, which means the outcome is not in my hands.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to try to change or blame another, it&rsquo;s to make the most of myself.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to care for, but to care about.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to fix, but to be supportive.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to judge, but to allow another to be a human being.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes, but to allow others to affect their own destinies.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to deny, but to accept.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to nag, scold, or argue, but instead to search out my own shortcomings and correct them.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">To &ldquo;let go&rdquo; is not to criticize and regulate anybody, but to try to become what I dream I can be.</p>

            <div class="prayer-body">
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for tonight, I will be grateful. I will give thanks for the past day &mdash; its failures as well as its successes, its sadness as well as its joy and its pain as well as its pleasure. I will take comfort in knowing that every event and circumstance that occurred today can be used for my good and the good of others.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for tonight, I will accept that I have done the best I could, remembering that my goal is spiritual progress and not perfection. I will let go of any expectation I had for this day, as well as any disappointment, shame or guilt I felt for not being perfect today.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for tonight, I will be humble. I will give my shortcomings to a Power greater than myself, trusting that doing so can bring about changes in me that I could not bring about by myself.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for tonight, I will not attempt to rectify today&rsquo;s mistakes or solve tomorrow&rsquo;s problems. I will remind myself that I am better able to receive guidance when my mind and body are rested and refreshed.</p>
            <p class="prayer-text">Just for tonight, I will set aside my fears, frustrations and aspirations and take a few minutes to review the abundance that exists in my life today. I will place my future in the care of a loving God of my own understanding, trusting my needs will be met at a time and in a way that is best for all concerned.</p>
