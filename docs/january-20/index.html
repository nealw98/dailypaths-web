          <p>I wore my suffering like a badge. Look how much I endured. See how dedicated I was. Notice how I sacrificed everything while others did nothing. My martyrdom felt righteous, even holy. I was the good one, the responsible one, the one who cared enough to shoulder everyone's burdens.</p>
<p>But Step One revealed something uncomfortable: my role as martyr had taken responsibility away from other people. By doing everything, managing everything, suffering through everything, I had communicated that others were incapable of handling their own lives. My martyrdom wasn't serving them – it was infantilizing them.</p>
<p>I had to see how much my identity depended on being the one who suffered most, who did most, who sacrificed most. Without this role, who was I? The question terrified me. But staying in martyrdom meant keeping everyone stuck in their current roles – me as the suffering helper, them as the helpless ones who needed my management.</p>
<p>Releasing the martyr role was an act of respect. It acknowledged that others had their own agency, their own responsibilities, their own paths. It freed them to step up and freed me to step back. My suffering hadn't been helping anyone – it had just created a dysfunctional system where no one could grow.</p>
