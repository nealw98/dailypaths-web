          <p>My mind had become occupied territory. Every thought circled back to the drinking. How much, when, why, what it meant, what I should do about it. The disease had colonized my mental space so thoroughly that I had almost no thoughts that belonged to myself anymore.</p>
<p>Step One offered an unexpected gift: the return of my own mind. When I admitted powerlessness and stopped trying to control the disease, when I turned my attention to working on myself, mental space became available for other things. I could think about my interests, my goals, my feelings. I could have thoughts that weren't about alcohol.</p>
<p>This freedom was disorienting at first. I had lived so long with all-consuming thoughts of the disease that I didn't know what to do with a mind that wasn't entirely occupied by worry and strategizing. I almost reached back for those familiar obsessions, uncomfortable with the spaciousness that acceptance created.</p>
<p>But gradually, I learned to inhabit my own mind again. I discovered interests I'd forgotten, feelings I'd suppressed, dreams I'd abandoned. My thoughts became mine once more. The disease still existed, but it no longer had squatter's rights in my consciousness.</p>
