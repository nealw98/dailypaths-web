          <p>I carried the burden of someone else's sobriety as if it were mine to carry. The weight was crushing. Every drink felt like my failure. Every promise broken left me more defeated. I was responsible for outcomes I had no power to create, and the impossibility of my situation grew heavier with each passing day.</p>
<p>My admission of powerlessness took the burden off me. Not gradually, but immediately. The burden had never been mine – I had simply picked it up and carried it, believing this was what love required. But love doesn't require us to carry what we cannot carry. It requires honesty about our limitations.</p>
<p>Without the burden, I could stand upright for the first time in years. I could breathe fully. I could consider my own needs without the constant weight of someone else's disease pressing down on me. The relief was physical, emotional, and spiritual all at once.</p>
<p>I've learned that we often confuse burden-carrying with caring. We believe that if we're not weighed down by someone else's problems, we don't really love them. But the opposite is true. Real love respects boundaries, acknowledges limitations, and allows each person to carry what is theirs to carry. The burden wasn't helping anyone – it was just slowly crushing me.</p>
