          <p>Truth and hope seemed incompatible. How could accepting that I had no power to stop the drinking be anything other than defeat? I resisted this truth with everything in me, certain that acceptance meant giving up, abandoning someone I loved to their disease.</p>
<p>But acceptance is not abandonment. It's alignment with reality. I didn't have the power to stop the drinking – that was simply true, whether I accepted it or not. My resistance didn't change the truth; it only exhausted me with the effort of fighting against what was real.</p>
<p>When I finally accepted this truth, something unexpected happened. The constant tension in my body eased, and I began to see how this same need to control manifested in other areas of my life. I started recognizing my attempts to micromanage my children's choices, dictate outcomes at work, and even shape friends' opinions. This realization brought an uncomfortable clarity: my powerlessness over alcohol was just one facet of a much larger pattern.</p>
<p>Letting go of the alcoholic’s drinking showed me that acceptance in these other areas brought the same freedom. When I stopped fighting reality and trying to control situations and people, a similar quietness settled over me. It was like finally releasing a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.</p>
