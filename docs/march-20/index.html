          <p>I am comfortable turning my life and my will over to the God of my understanding. These words would have seemed impossible to me when I first came to Al-Anon. Comfortable? With surrender? How could giving up control ever feel comfortable? But that was before I understood what I was actually surrendering and who I was surrendering to.</p>
<p>Comfort came gradually through experience. Each time I turned something over and the world didn't end. Each time I released control and found things actually worked out better than when I was managing. Each time I trusted my Higher Power and discovered that trust was warranted. Small experiences built on each other until surrender began to feel less like loss and more like relief.</p>
<p>The comfort also came from getting to know my Higher Power better. The more I experienced this Power as loving helpful trustworthy the easier it became to entrust my life and will to that care. I wouldn't be comfortable turning things over to the punishing God I once believed in. But the God I've come to know through my own experience? That God I can trust.</p>
<p>Comfortable doesn't mean it's always easy. Some days surrender still feels hard. But I'm no longer fighting against the whole concept. I know from experience that turning my will and life over leads to freedom not bondage. That knowledge brings comfort even on difficult days.</p>
