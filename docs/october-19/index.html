          <p>If completing the first nine Steps doesn't eliminate all problems, what does Step Ten actually do? It helps us keep our bad times fewer and farther between. This is the definition of progress, not perfection. The emotional flare-ups, the resentments that lasted for weeks, the days I spent frozen in fear—these don't vanish, but they become smaller, shorter, and less frequent.</p>
<p>This practical, measurable progress is hugely encouraging. I no longer spiral for three days over a slight; I might feel defensive for three minutes and then correct it. For example, just last week, my partner unintentionally said something that would have sent me into a silent, simmering rage for days a few years ago. My old pattern would have been to withdraw completely, replaying the slight over and over in my head, crafting elaborate arguments that would never be spoken. This time, I caught myself internally building that wall. I paused, took a breath, and instead of stewing, I decided to directly ask for clarity. It wasn't perfect, but the interaction was resolved in an hour, not days. This costs me the emotional investment I used to have in my own drama. The payoff is that the overall trajectory of my life points toward peace. Step 10 is also about continuing to grow. I can recognize changes and continue to move forward.</p>

          <p>I will think back to a time six months ago when a specific trigger (e.g., unexpected call, slight delay) ruined my whole day. If that trigger happens today, I will apply the tools and see how quickly I recover, celebrating the reduction in duration of the 'bad time.'</p>
