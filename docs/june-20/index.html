          <p>I've been frustrated with Step Six because I became ready to have my controlling removed months ago and I'm still controlling. I declared my readiness. I prayed about it. I did everything right. Why hasn't God removed this defect yet? Why am I still struggling with the same patterns?</p>
<p>Since God is in charge God gets to choose when and how fast He will remove my defects of character. God's timing not mine. God's process not the one I would design. This is so hard to accept. I want the defects gone immediately once I've done my part of becoming ready. But that's still me trying to control the process – still operating on my timeline my expectations.</p>
<p>Maybe God knows I'm not as ready as I think I am. Maybe there's more work I need to do first. Maybe the removing is happening so slowly I can't see it yet. Maybe God's timing is wiser than mine even when I can't understand it. I have to trust that God gets to choose when and how fast. My job is to stay ready and trust the process.</p>
<p>Letting go of my timeline for God's work – that's another layer of surrender.</p>
