          <p>My intentions were always good. I helped because I cared. I intervened because I loved. I managed because I was trying to keep everyone safe. How could efforts rooted in love be part of the problem? Yet Step One asks me to consider exactly that – my well-meaning efforts may have contributed to the dysfunction I was trying to prevent.</p>
<p>This is one of the hardest concepts to grasp in recovery. I wasn't deliberately making things worse. I was doing what any caring person would do – or so I thought. But enabling, controlling, and rescuing can masquerade as love while actually preventing the natural consequences that might lead to change.</p>
<p>I've learned that good intentions don't automatically produce good results. My efforts to prevent crisis may have delayed the moment when crisis could become a teacher. In trying to shield others from consequences, I may have also blocked the lessons those consequences were meant to teach. My attempts to shield from consequences may have prevented the learning that consequences provide. My rescue missions may have communicated that I believed the other person was incapable of handling their own life.</p>
<p>Accepting that my well-meaning efforts were part of the problem required deep humility. It meant questioning everything I thought I knew about helping and loving. But this painful awareness opened the door to a different kind of care – one that respects boundaries, allows consequences, and trusts that others have their own path to walk.</p>
