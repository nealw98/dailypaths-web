          <p>Yesterday I was struggling with Step Six and feeling stuck. How can I trust God to remove my character defects when I can barely trust God with daily life? My sponsor asked me to look back at Step Three. What did I do there? I turned my will and my life over to the care of God. My whole life. Everything.</p>
<p>I realized that I had already turned my will and my life over to His care. Already. Past tense. In Step Three I made that decision. I committed to trusting God with everything not just the convenient parts. My character defects are part of my life – part of what I already turned over.</p>
<p>This realization shifts everything about Step Six. I'm not being asked to trust God with something new. I'm being asked to remember the trust I already committed to in Step Three. My character defects were included in that turning over even if I didn't understand it at the time. Step Six is just the practical application of Step Three's decision.</p>
<p>I already turned my will and life over. That includes the defects. Now I just need to become ready for God to remove what I already surrendered.</p>
