          <p>The language 'seek a Power greater than ourselves' gave me permission to not have it all figured out. I don't have to arrive with a complete understanding of God or spirituality. I just have to seek. To look. To be willing to explore the possibility that something beyond my own limited resources might be able to help me.</p>
<p>For years I'd relied only on myself. I was the strong one, the capable one, the one who handled everything. Asking for help felt like weakness. Admitting I needed something greater than myself felt like failure. But my self-reliance had brought me to complete desperation. My own resources—my intelligence, my determination, my willpower—weren't enough for this situation.</p>
<p>Seeking a Power greater than myself meant acknowledging that limitation. It meant admitting I needed help from somewhere beyond my own capabilities. That was humbling, but also strangely relieving. I didn't have to have all the answers anymore. I didn't have to be sufficient unto myself. I could seek help from something larger, wiser, more powerful than my limited self.</p>
<p>The seeking itself was the Step. I didn't have to find perfect faith or complete understanding. I just had to be willing to look beyond myself, to consider that maybe help existed outside my own resources. The seeking opened me to possibilities I'd been too proud or too scared to consider before.</p>
