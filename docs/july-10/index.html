          <p>I prayed Step Seven two months ago. I asked God humbly to remove my people-pleasing. I meant it. I was ready. I truly asked. And yesterday I said yes to something I desperately wanted to say no to just to avoid someone's disappointment. The people-pleasing is still here. Still operating. Still controlling my choices. Did God hear my prayer? Does God care?</p>
<p>It is important to remember that all of our defects will probably not disappear immediately. Probably not immediately. This is the part I didn't want to hear. I wanted one sincere prayer to remove the defect instantly. But God's removal often works gradually. The people-pleasing is still here but I caught myself doing it. That's new. I felt the no in my body even though I said yes. That awareness is progress even though the behavior hasn't fully changed.</p>
<p>My sponsor said her experience with Step Seven taught her that God removes defects on God's timeline not hers. Sometimes immediately. Usually gradually. Always in God's way. My job is to keep asking and cooperating not to demand immediate proof that God heard me. The removal is happening even when I can't see it yet.</p>

          <p>When the defect I prayed about activates again, instead of despair I can write three evidence points: I caught myself this time. It didn't last as long. I felt the cost more clearly. God is working even when I can't see dramatic change.</p>
