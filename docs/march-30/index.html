          <p>Our trust and confidence support that person's competence autonomy and personal dignity. I've seen this truth both ways – how trust builds people up and how distrust tears them down. When I micromanage and second-guess others I communicate that I don't believe in their ability. My distrust becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>But when I offer trust I give people room to rise to the occasion. My confidence in them supports their confidence in themselves. My respect for their autonomy honors their dignity as capable adults. Trust creates space for growth while control keeps everyone small.</p>
<p>This applies to how I related to the alcoholic. My constant monitoring and management communicated that I thought they were incompetent unable to handle their own life. My rescuing suggested they weren't capable of facing consequences. I thought I was helping but I was actually undermining their dignity.</p>
<p>Now I'm learning to offer trust as a gift. Not naive trust that ignores reality but respectful trust that acknowledges others' agency. When I trust someone to make their own decisions I'm supporting their competence even if they make choices I wouldn't make. When I respect their autonomy I'm honoring their dignity as a person. Trust is one of the most loving things I can offer.</p>
