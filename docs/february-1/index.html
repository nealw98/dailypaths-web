          <p>For so long I believed that powerless meant helpless. If I couldn't control the alcoholic's drinking, if I couldn't fix the situation, if I couldn't force solutions—then what could I do? Nothing, I thought. I was stuck, trapped, without options. Powerlessness felt like defeat, like giving up, like accepting that I'd just have to suffer through whatever happened.</p>
<p>Step Two showed me I'd confused two very different things. Yes, I'm powerless over alcohol and the alcoholic. That's Step One, and it's true. But helpless? No. I have help available—a Power greater than myself, a fellowship of people who understand, tools and principles that actually work. Powerless doesn't mean I have no resources. It means I can't do this alone, and I don't have to.</p>
<p>The distinction changed everything for me. I stopped exhausting myself trying to control what I couldn't and started reaching for the help that was available. I called my sponsor. I attended meetings. I worked the Steps. I turned situations over to my Higher Power. None of these actions controlled the alcoholic, but they all helped me. I wasn't helpless at all—I just needed to stop trying to be all-powerful and accept the help being offered.</p>
<p>Today when I feel overwhelmed and stuck, I remember: powerless doesn't mean helpless. I have a Higher Power. I have this program. I have people who care. Help is available if I'm willing to reach for it.</p>
