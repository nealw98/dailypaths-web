          <p>Last week I had a difficult conversation I'd been dreading. I prepared carefully chose my words wisely spoke from my heart. And it didn't go the way I hoped. The other person got defensive we both got hurt and nothing was resolved. I hung up the phone feeling like I'd failed like all my preparation had been worthless.</p>
<p>Then I remembered: turning our will and lives over to God means putting the outcome in God's hands. I had done my part – prepared spoken honestly showed up with care. The outcome wasn't mine to determine. That conversation might plant seeds that take months to grow. It might open doors I can't see yet. Or it might simply be what it was and that's okay too.</p>
<p>I've confused doing my best with controlling the results for so long. I think if I just do things well enough I can make things turn out right. But outcomes live in territory beyond my influence. I can control my actions not their effects. I can choose my words not how they're received.</p>
<p>Putting outcomes in God's hands feels like letting go of the steering wheel while the car is moving. Terrifying. But I'm learning that I was never actually steering anyway.</p>
