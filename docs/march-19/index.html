          <p>I have learned that He helps me accomplish things that I never thought I could. When I look back at my journey in Al-Anon I'm amazed at what's become possible. I've set boundaries I was sure would destroy relationships. I've spoken truths I was certain I could never say. I've let go of people and situations I was convinced I couldn't survive without. I've changed in ways I didn't think were possible for me.</p>
<p>None of this happened through my own strength alone. I tried for years to make these changes by sheer willpower and failed repeatedly. But when I started asking my Higher Power for help something shifted. Not overnight. Not dramatically. But steadily surely gradually I found myself doing things I couldn't do before.</p>
<p>This isn't about my Higher Power doing things for me while I sit passively. It's about a partnership. I show up willing to take action and I'm given strength beyond what I possess alone. I make myself available and I'm guided toward possibilities I couldn't see by myself. I do my part and my Higher Power makes it effective in ways I don't fully understand.</p>
<p>What once seemed impossible now feels within reach. Not because I've become superhuman but because I've learned to work with a Power greater than myself. Together we can do what I couldn't do alone.</p>
