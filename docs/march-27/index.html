          <p>Our meeting has members focused on different aspects of alcoholism. Some are dealing with currently drinking spouses. Others have parents who died from the disease decades ago. Some struggle with adult children. Others with siblings or friends. We each came with different stories different pain different relationships to the disease.</p>
<p>Yet focusing on a particular area of recovery does not change the fact that our similarities outweigh our differences. We all know what it's like to love someone whose drinking we cannot control. We all understand the exhaustion of trying to fix the unfixable. We all recognize the relief that comes from finally admitting powerlessness.</p>
<p>I've learned more from people whose situations look nothing like mine than I ever imagined possible. The woman whose father was alcoholic taught me about setting boundaries even though my situation involves a spouse. The man dealing with his adult son's drinking helped me understand detachment though my struggle is with my sister. Our circumstances differ but the principles remain the same.</p>
<p>This unity in diversity is one of Al-Anon's greatest gifts. I don't need someone whose situation exactly matches mine to understand me. The disease affects us all similarly regardless of the specific relationship. We speak a common language even when our stories sound different. Our similarities create the foundation for genuine fellowship.</p>
