          <p>I spent years thinking spirituality was about getting the theology right. If I could just understand God correctly believe the right things follow the proper practices then I'd be spiritual. But Step Three kept eluding me. I had the concepts but not the connection. I knew about God but didn't know God.</p>
<p>Then I understood: it was about my own personal relationship with a Higher Power. Not about adopting someone else's experience or conforming to a particular tradition. Not about having the right answers or perfect understanding. But about actual relationship – personal lived immediate.</p>
<p>This shifted everything. Relationship doesn't require perfection. It requires showing up. It doesn't demand certainty. It asks for honesty. I didn't need to have God figured out before I could relate. I just needed to be willing to engage with whatever I understood Higher Power to be at that moment.</p>
<p>My relationship with my Higher Power has become the most important one in my recovery. Not because I understand God perfectly – I don't. Not because I always feel close or connected – I don't. But because I keep showing up keep being honest keep asking for help. That's what relationship is: consistent presence even when it's messy or unclear.</p>
