          <p>Yesterday someone at our business meeting nominated me for group representative. My immediate response was: I'm not qualified. I don't know enough. I'll mess it up. But the group chose me anyway. Then our outgoing rep said: My job is to assist you in learning the role and then allow you to do it. Not micromanage. Allow.</p>
<p>To delegate with confidence the groups the Conference and the Board of Trustees learn to choose competent leaders assist in setting the direction and tone desired and then allow those designated to do their jobs. Choose, assist, allow. Not choose and control. Not assist and micromanage. Choose competent people, give them guidance and support, then allow them to do the job. Trust the choice. Trust the person. Trust the process.</p>
<p>This applies to how I let others support my recovery. I chose my sponsor carefully. Now I need to allow her to sponsor me her way not insist she do it my way. I asked my home group to help hold me accountable. Now I need to allow them to do that instead of defending when they point things out. Choose competently, assist with direction, allow them to do their job. That's delegation with confidence. The alternative is choosing people and then controlling them which isn't delegation at all. It's just control with extra steps.</p>

          <p>I can examine my relationship with my sponsor or others I've asked to support my recovery. Have I chosen them and then tried to control how they help? I can practice: choose competently, communicate what I need, then allow them to help their way. Trust the choice means allowing them to do their job without my micromanagement.</p>
